# Project 3 | Problems vs. Algorithms

## Descreption 
In this project, we will answer the seven questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the basic algorithms you've learned
in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python.


## Problems

**Problem 1 | Square Root of an Integer :**
In this problem we have to find the square root of the integer without using any Python library.

**Problem 2 | Search in a Rotated Sorted Array :**
In this problem we will recive target value and sorted array. This array is rotated at some random pivot point. For example [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
Now we have to search in this array in the order of O(log n). If found target value in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

**Problem 3 | Rearrange Array Digits :**
In this problem we have to rearrange array elements so as to form two number such that their sum is maximum for e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The expected answer would be [531, 42].
Another expected answer can be [542, 31] we have to implement in time complexity is O(nlog(n)).

**Problem 4 | Dutch National Flag Problem :**
In this problem,  we have an input array consisting of only 0, 1, and 2 . And we have to sort the array in a single traversal this means we have to implement a sort algorithm
in O(n) linear time complexity.

**Problem 5 | Autocomplete with Tries :**
In this problem, we have to build autocomplete program like autocomplete on the search engine Google and in any social media chatting.

**Problem 6 | Unsorted Integer Array :**
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time.

**Problem 7 | Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie :**
In this problem, we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure.
